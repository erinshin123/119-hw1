size is the number of elements in the input dataset for the pipeline,

===== Questions 6-10: Performance Comparison 1 =====

For our first performance comparison,
let's look at the cost of getting input from a file, vs. in an existing DataFrame.

6. We will use the same population dataset
that we used in lecture 3.

Load the data using load_input() given the file name.

- Make sure that you clean the data by removing
  continents and world data!
  (World data is listed under OWID_WRL)

Then, set up a simple pipeline that computes summary statistics
for the following:

- *Year over year increase* in population, per country

    (min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation)

How you should compute this:

- For each country, we need the maximum year and the minimum year
in the data. We should divide the population difference
over this time by the length of the time period.

- Make sure you throw out the cases where there is only one year
(if any).

- We should at this point have one data point per country.

- Finally, as your answer, return a list of the:
    min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation
  of the data.

Hints:
You can use the describe() function in Pandas to get these statistics.
You should be able to do something like
df.describe().loc["min"]["colum_name"]

to get a specific value from the describe() function.

You shouldn't use any for loops.
See if you can compute this using Pandas functions only.

- the cost of querying via Pandas methods vs querying via SQL
  For this part: you would want to use something like
  pandasql that can run SQL queries on Pandas data frames. See:
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/45866311/2038713

As your answer to this part,
as before, return
a. the list of 6 throughputs
and
b. the list of 2 latencies.

and generate plots for each of these in the following files:

    output/part2-ec-b.png
